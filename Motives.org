"Your competitors would rather fail than acknowledge your expertise and
follow in your footsteps using your intellectual property. They don't
want your IP because it's worthless, and they are sure of it. So,
contributing that new feature that is so important to your business is
likely going to create zero buzz at your competitor's HQ, yet still give
you the benefits discussed above."

-  ways to contribute ** Blog about open source adoption and
   contribution (e.g. Netflix). ** Partner with an open source project
   for a case study. ** Speak at a technical conference. ** Offer to
   host meet-ups for the project. ** Donate to or participate in
   foundations associated with projects (e.g. OSI, OuterCurve, Eclipse
   Foundation, and others).
