Open-source software
====================

-   Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code
    made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides
    the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone
    and for any purpose.\[1\] Open-source software may be developed in a
    collaborative public manner. Open-source software is the most
    prominent example of open-source development and often compared to
    (technically defined) user-generated content or (legally defined)
    open-content movements.\[2\]
