# Open Access

  * Open access (OA) means unrestricted online access to peer-reviewed scholarly research. Open access is primarily intended for scholarly journals, but is also provided for a growing number of theses,[2] book chapters,[3] and monographs.[4]
  * Open access comes in two degrees: gratis open access, which is free online access, and libre open access, which is free online access plus some additional usage rights.[5] These additional usage rights are often granted through the use of various specific Creative Commons licenses.[6] Only libre open access is fully compliant with definitions of open access such as the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.
