Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?

From freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/misc.html#bikeshed-painting;
see also phk.freebsd.dk/sagas/bikeshed.html for historical background.

    "The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change."
