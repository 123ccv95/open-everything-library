* Infrastructure of Openness

-  open platforms, both virtual and physical, which allow us to produce
   in a open way:
-  open collaborative technical platforms,
-  open places where we can gather
-  open media and communication infrastructures we can use
-  open and free software knowledge and scientific data
-  ability to live in open and free villages and urban spaces, which
   connect local production with global open design communities. Source:
