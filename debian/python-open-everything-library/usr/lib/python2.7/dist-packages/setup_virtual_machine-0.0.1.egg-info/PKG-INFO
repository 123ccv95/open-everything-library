Description: Wikipedia categories are mis used for many things. The category on some abstract topic will then contain people related to it, services implementing it etc. I want to clean up this in wikidata and use clear relationships between the categories. 
        
        Focused on free software I want to make sure all the categories are in wikidata with the right relationships.
        Pages in the categories will be added as well.
        data/allcats.txt contains the categories I am processing, and data/ignore.txt is the exclusion list.
