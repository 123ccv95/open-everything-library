# Open source



  * In production and development, open source as a development model promotes a universal access via a free license to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint, including subsequent improvements to it by anyone.

#  Aspects of Openness



  * inclusionality or open access

  * permission-less contributions

  * full transparency of that process

  * full share-ability and ‘changeability’ of the common material. 

  * All these represent new social expectations, and are key ingredients of commons-based peer production as well.

# Infrastructure of Openness



  * open platforms, both virtual and physical, which allow us to produce in a open way: 

  * open collaborative technical platforms, 

  * open places where we can gather

  * open media and communication infrastructures we can use

  * open and free software knowledge and scientific data

  * ability to live in open and free villages and urban spaces, which connect local production with global open design communities.

# Social peer-to-peer processes



  * peer production - the collaborative production of use value is open to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by Yochai Benkler, in his essay Coase's Penguin);[1]

  * peer governance - production or project is governed by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy;

  * peer property - the use-value of property is freely accessible on a universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize individual authorship (i.e. the GNU General Public License or the Creative Commons licenses).

# Open-source software



  * Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.[1] Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. Open-source software is the most prominent example of open-source development and often compared to (technically defined) user-generated content or (legally defined) open-content movements.[2]

# Four Freedoms



  * A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:

  * The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).

  * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

  * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).

  * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

# Open knowledge



  * Open knowledge is knowledge that one is free to use, reuse, and redistribute without legal, social or technological restriction.[1] Open knowledge is a set of principles and methodologies related to the production and distribution of knowledge works in an open manner. Knowledge is interpreted broadly to include data, content and general information.

# Open Data



  * Open data is the idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.[1] The goals of the open data movement are similar to those of other "Open" movements such as open source, open hardware, open content, and open access.

# Open Access



  * Open access (OA) means unrestricted online access to peer-reviewed scholarly research. Open access is primarily intended for scholarly journals, but is also provided for a growing number of theses,[2] book chapters,[3] and monographs.[4]

  * Open access comes in two degrees: gratis open access, which is free online access, and libre open access, which is free online access plus some additional usage rights.[5] These additional usage rights are often granted through the use of various specific Creative Commons licenses.[6] Only libre open access is fully compliant with definitions of open access such as the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.

#  Open access teached its tipping point in 2011



  * The year 2011 is a milestone for open access. By this analysis, 50% of all scientific articles published in 2011 are currently available in some open access form or another, and the trend is toward more and more articles becoming open access.

# Open Source Hardware



  * Open-source hardware (OSH) consists of physical artifacts of technology designed and offered by the open design movement. Both free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware is created by this open-source culture movement and applies a like concept to a variety of components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as FOSH (free and open source hardware). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it - coupling it closely to the maker movement.[1] Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings, schematics, bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source code and integrated circuit layout data), in addition to the software that drives the hardware, are all released under free/libre terms. The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant evidence that such sharing creates enormous economic value.[2]

# Open Source Ecology



  * Open Source Ecology (OSE) is a network of farmers, engineers, architects and supporters, whose main goal is the eventual manufacturing of the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS). As described by Open Source Ecology "the GVCS is an open technological platform that allows for the easy fabrication of the 50 different Industrial Machines that it takes to build a small civilization with modern comforts."[3] Groups in Oberlin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and California are developing blueprints, and building prototypes in order to pass them on to Missouri.[4][5][6] The devices are built and tested on the Factor e Farm in rural Missouri.

# OpenContent



  * Retain - the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)

  * Reuse - the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)

  * Revise - the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)

  * Remix - the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)

  * Redistribute - the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)[3]

# One laptop per child



  * Mission Statement: To create educational opportunities for the world's poorest children by providing each child with a rugged, low-cost, low-power, connected laptop with content and software designed for collaborative, joyful, self-empowered learning. When children have access to this type of tool they get engaged in their own education. They learn, share, create, and collaborate. They become connected to each other, to the world and to a brighter future.
