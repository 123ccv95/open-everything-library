* Social peer-to-peer processes

-  peer production - the collaborative production of use value is open
   to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by
   Yochai Benkler, in his essay Coase's Penguin);[1]
-  peer governance - production or project is governed by the community
   of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate
   hierarchy;
-  peer property - the use-value of property is freely accessible on a
   universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through
   new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize
   individual authorship (i.e. the GNU General Public License or the
   Creative Commons licenses).
