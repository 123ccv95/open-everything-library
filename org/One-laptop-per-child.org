* One laptop per child

-  Mission Statement: To create educational opportunities for the
   world's poorest children by providing each child with a rugged,
   low-cost, low-power, connected laptop with content and software
   designed for collaborative, joyful, self-empowered learning. When
   children have access to this type of tool they get engaged in their
   own education. They learn, share, create, and collaborate. They
   become connected to each other, to the world and to a brighter
   future. Source : [[http://laptop.org/en/]]
