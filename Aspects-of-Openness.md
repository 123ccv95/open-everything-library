Aspects of Openness
===================

-   inclusionality or *open access*
-   permission-less contributions
-   full transparency of that process
-   full share-ability and â€˜changeability' of the common material.
-   All these represent new social expectations, and are key ingredients
    of commons-based peer production as well.
