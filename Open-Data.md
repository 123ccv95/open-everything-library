# Open Data

  * Open data is the idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.[1] The goals of the open data movement are similar to those of other "Open" movements such as open source, open hardware, open content, and open access.
