Software Freedom Conservancy is a not-for-profit charity that helps
promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source
Software (FLOSS) projects. Conservancy provides a non-profit home and
infrastructure for FLOSS projects. This allows FLOSS developers to focus
on what they do best --- writing and improving FLOSS for the general
public --- while Conservancy takes care of the projects' needs that do
not relate directly to software development and documentation.
