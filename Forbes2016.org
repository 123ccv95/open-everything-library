    "And, above all, we've got to beware of anyone proposing 'smart' this or
    that that's going to talk to the Internet---or, the 'Internet of things.'
    Their idea, I guess, is that every appliance in your house will be yet
    another surveillance opportunity for the NSA to---and also, if it's running

    things,' unless it's [sic] running free software and set up by people I
    know I can trust not to turn it [sic] into a tentacle of surveillance.
