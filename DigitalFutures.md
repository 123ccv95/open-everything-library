n “Digital Futures: Changes in scholarship, open educational resources and the
inevitability of interdisciplinarity” by Eileen Scanlon, she states that the
changes in digital humanities around Web 2.0 are a landscape for communication
and for access to resources. These things have changed irrevocably the
practices of scholarships (p.178). I think that the rise of digital humanities
is on a peak because of the XY and Z generations. Students have grown up in a
digital age and think about the process of information differently from
previous cohorts of students and that the education system should change as a
consequence (Scanlon, p.178). The idea of collaborative research is definitely
a thing within the MLIS program at UWO as there is group work in almost every
course offered. Although this might be frustrating for many students, I feel as
though when we start working in our desired disciplines, collaborative research
will seem more appealing to us. There are many skills that researchers and
teachers need to develop (Scanlon, p.181). We need to explore working in a open
way because research can now be available to a much wider audience due the new
tools (Scanlon, p.181).
