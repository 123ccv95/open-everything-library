#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Free Geek is a non-profit organization started in Portland, Oregon in
  2000. Free Geek has two central goals: to reuse or recycle used
  computer equipment that might otherwise become hazardous waste, and to
  make computer technology more accessible to those who lack financial
  means or technical knowledge.

  Free Geek's refurbished computers run Linux Mint (originally standard
  Ubuntu) and other free and open-source software. The use of free
  software has several major benefits to the organization, and to the
  recipients of equipment: Free Geek operates without needing to devote
  resources to managing software licenses, and may install software
  where it is needed with minimal complications from legal
  considerations; and computer recipients get a wide range of software,
  which they may easily expand without paying money or entering into
  restrictive contracts.
