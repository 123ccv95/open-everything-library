-  ”There is another, deeper issue at stake here. The tendency of
   digitalization is to convert public libraries into retail stores for
   vendors of digital works. The choice to distribute information in a
   secret format--information designed to evaporate and become
   unreadable--is the antithesis of the spirit of the public library.”
