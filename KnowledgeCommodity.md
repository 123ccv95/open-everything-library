Commodification has been and still is one of the key processes within
capitalist market economies.

Since the 1970s, different forms of knowledge have increasingly been subjected
to this process.

In this paper the commodification of knowledge in the field of higher education is defined in a broad sense as an
example of the intensive enlargement of capitalism.

I argue that knowledge shares some features of public goods and can be
subjected to commodification both as an educational product and academic
research itself.

However, the simple dichotomy of public vs. private good is not nuanced enough
to understand the status of knowledge within higher education.

How to reconstruct this dichotomy, whether knowledge should be commodified, and
how to justify one’s normative stance in this respect are three important
issues for further study.

Introduction

It is commonplace to note that knowledge has become an important, if not the most important,
factor of production even though it is also reasonable to say that economies have always been
based on inventions, creation and dissemination of knowledge (see e.g. David
and Foray, 2002: 9).

One reason why it makes sense to use such terms as ‘knowledge-driven economy’,
‘knowledge based economy’, or ‘knowledge capitalism’ is the increasingly systematized and broadened commodification
of knowledge through intellectual property rights (e.g. Kauppinen, 2008).

Other reasons involve, for instance, the acceleration of knowledge production
and revolutions in information technology (David and Foray, 2002: 9–12; see
also Jessop, 2007: 122).

Many see knowledge, and especially innovations, as of utmost importance in respect to firms’
economic competitiveness in globalizing knowledge capitalism. Lyotard (1984: 5) claimed that in
the commodity form knowledge has become the major stake in the global
competition for power (see also David and Foray, 2002: 11).

This kind of claim can be supported by referring to transnational corporations and how they battle
for control not only over raw materials and cheap labour, but also over high
technology and scientific research around the globe (Kauppinen, 2012).

As Bob Jessop (2007: 115, 122) has noted this makes one think about what kind
of status knowledge might have as a commodity. However, it is not necessarily
an easy task to articulate whether, and in which sense, knowledge can be
treated as a commodity or exclusive property.

Indeed, sometimes it has been stated that knowledge, and more specifically
scientific theories, cannot be commodities because of public good
characteristics of knowledge (see O’Neill, 1998:149–51).

A further difficulty is that the words ‘commodity’ and ‘commodification’ are
used, for instance, in higher education research to refer to different
institutions, activities, processes and entities such as higher education
services, educational products, intellectual property rights (e.g. patents and
copyrights), and start-up firms.

For example, Noble (1998) uses the expression ‘commodification of higher
education’ to refer to the transformation of the educational process into
commodity form so that it can be subjected to commercial transaction. Furthermore, Shumar (2008: 73) has claimed
that mall spaces found on campuses affect students’ and faculty’s consciousness and, consequently,
how they perceive the production of knowledge:

‘Like the commodities in the stores, students come to think of course work and
research as another commodity form’.

Moreover, Sappey (2005) has argued that the commodity view of higher education
has been one of the most important structural changes in the field of higher
education. Education is no longer seen mainly as a way to pursue socially
valuable knowledge, but as a process wherein value is determined by how much
direct benefit it will bring to the student-consumer.

For this reason, the term commodification describes the task of the management
and production process to increase the quality of educational products on the
basis of student-customer satisfaction.

More broadly, ‘the implications are that higher education institutions are
drawn into the market, producing and selling knowledge as a commodity. It also
places the consumer, as constructed by management and their perceptions of
customer needs and wants, at the centre of organisational focus and strategy’
(Sappey, 2005: 496).

The previous discussion implies that ‘not-for-profit institutions in the academy are taking on the
characteristics and activities of profit-making organizations. Universities are not just servants of or
suppliers to the marketplace. They are active players in the marketplace’,

for instance, by selling packaged goods such as patents (Rhoades and Slaughter,
1997: 13) as well as educational products (e.g. degrees).

In other words, universities treat knowledge increasingly as ‘raw material’ to be
produced, protected, and then sold in markets (Slaughter and Rhoades, 2004). Increased opportunity
to treat knowledge as raw material to be eventually commodified is enabled, for instance, by
the increasing financial and administrative autonomy of universities (Estermann and Nokkala,
2009).

Clearing the Ground

Knowledge

Ambiguity in the definitions of ‘knowledge’ and ‘information’ may cause
confusion and misunderstandings if the meanings of these terms are not properly
distinguished.

Also, by way of analogy, I find Noel Castree’s (2003: 275) formulation highly
relevant. Qualitative differences among ‘natural’ entities, can easily be
glossed when the one category ‘nature’ is used as a shorthand to refer to …
substantively different things … The reason is that the process of capitalist
commodification is not necessarily indifferent
to the natures being commodified. That is, the process of capitalist
commodification (or its effects) might operate rather differently depending on
which particular natures are being commodified.

So the lack of clarity I detect in Marxian accounts of nature’s commodification
stems not just from the variety of uses of the latter term (commodification)
but from the semantic promiscuity of the former term (nature) too.

Indeed, similar points can be raised in the context of knowledge as commodity and commodification
of knowledge, or higher education. Terms ‘knowledge’ and ‘higher education’ may refer to
substantially different entities, activities or processes, and commodification of these is not organized
necessarily similarly. In a similar vein as ‘nature’, ‘knowledge’ and ‘higher education’ can
also be used as problematic shorthand for qualitatively different objects of study. These issues
cannot be solved simply by providing the definition of commodity, because ‘objects do not have a
commodity status built into them’ (Dant, 1999: 24).

For this reason, the key question is not
abstractly ‘what is a commodity?’ but rather ‘what kind of characteristics do things take-on when
they become commodities?’ as Castree (2003: 277) has formulated.
Thus, one of the problems regarding questions like, ‘can knowledge be treated as commodity’,
or ‘in which sense is knowledge commodity’ is that the term ‘knowledge’ is in itself ambiguous and
there are different types or forms of knowledge. But before distinguishing between different types
of knowledge it is necessary to distinguish between the terms ‘knowledge’ and ‘information’
instead of using them interchangeably.
As Peters (2001: 13) has pointed out, traditionally it has been thought that knowledge must
satisfy three conditions: a belief, a truth and a justification condition. Information understood here
‘as data transmitted from a “sender” to a “receiver”’ does not have to satisfy these three conditions.
Thus, ‘information’ refers in this paper to such objects as databases (e.g. lists of university students)
and downloadable files (e.g. songs in mp3 format). Moreover, information is treated as a
sub-category of knowledge since information can also be commodified.
Here it can be added that objects such as datasets, i.e. information, have to be activated and used
by those who are able, partly due to their knowledge, to ‘interpret and process’ (David and Foray,
2002: 12–13) respective information. When seen this way, knowledge refers to something people
possess, i.e. a cognitive capacity, while information refers to something passive that needs to be
interpreted by those who have the cognitive capacity.
From this we can proceed to make a distinction between propositional (or explicit) knowledge
and tacit knowledge (e.g. Polanyi, 1958; Ryle, 1949). The former refers to such knowledge that
involves facts about the world and scientific knowledge,3 i.e. know-what knowledge that can be
expressed in sentences, is often formal and can be shared (e.g. Nonaka, 1991: 98) while the latter
refers to know-how and know-who, i.e. knowledge of how to do something. Thus, in contrast to
propositional knowledge, tacit knowledge (i.e. know-how and know-who) usually refers to skills
and it is not necessarily easy to communicate this kind of knowledge (at low cost) to other individual
actors, or between organizations (see Olssen and Peters, 2005: 334). Nonaka (1991: 98), in
turn, has argued that tacit knowledge ‘consists of mental models, beliefs, and perspectives so
ingrained that we take them for granted and therefore cannot easily articulate them’. These are
some of the reasons why it is sometimes argued that instead of tacit knowledge, it is factual and
scientific know-what knowledge that ‘come closest to being market commodities or economic
resources that can be fitted into production functions’ (Olssen and Peters, 2005: 334). However,
this does not necessarily mean that propositional/explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge are disconnected
from each other. Hildreth and Kimble (2002), for instance, have argued that explicit (or
‘hard’) and tacit (or ‘soft’) dimensions of knowledge are interwoven (i.e. knowledge is a duality)
and tacit knowledge (e.g. linguistic rules as tacit subsidiary knowledge of a reader of some text)
may become at some other context explicit knowledge (e.g. when a person is conducting research
on linguistic rules).
Here it is also worthwhile to recognize briefly Machlup’s (1962) attempt to operationalize
knowledge (involving both ordinary and scientific knowledge) by making a distinction between
education, R&D, communication and information. Education refers to the distribution of knowledge
through different channels. R&D, in turn, refers to the creation or production of knowledge.
Communication refers to those channels or vehicles through which knowledge is distributed.
Finally, information refers to information services (e.g. legal and accounting services) and information
machines (e.g. information technology). From this point of view knowledge can be seen as
a communication process that involves different phases such as production and distribution of
knowledge. This kind of communication process can take place in many kinds of institutional
frameworks, and between different institutional frameworks.
Finally, it should be noted that all forms of knowledge and information always have some sort
of material basis. By this I mean that knowledge and information cannot exist or be used without
some sort of storage medium (in a broad sense) whether it is a DVD, PC, book or human body. In
other words, even though knowledge can be detached from the individual through different forms
of codification (e.g. David and Foray, 2002: 13) that knowledge still has to be stored somewhere.
Knowledge and information (though they can be seen as intangible assets) never just float in the
air, so to speak (see also Bunge, 1999).
Commodity
Marx begins his book Capital by analyzing the nature of commodity, i.e. the basic unit of the
capitalist mode of production: ‘A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing
that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another’ (Marx, 1906 [1867]: 41).
Here Marx is referring to the usefulness of commodities and their ability to fulfil some human
want or need. It is the qualitative aspects of commodities that make them useful for humans. If
a commodity is not perceived as having any use by some person, s/he will not be interested in
buying it. In this sense, the use-value of a commodity comes prior to its exchange-value, i.e. in
order to produce commodities for market-exchange one has to produce ‘use-values for others,
social use-values’ (Marx, 1906 [1867]: 48, emphasis added). Hence, commodities without social
use-values would not be exchanged in the market because there would be no one who would
want to buy them. For instance, scientific knowledge that would be seen useful only by
producer(s) would not survive the test of fictitious ‘theory markets’. For the sake of the argument,
here the social use-value would refer, for instance, to theory’s usefulness regarding the
internal development of science.
However, the fluent market-exchange of commodities with different use-values also requires
something else. For Marx, this additional element was ‘socially necessary labour’, i.e. a common
quantitative aspect of all commodities. According to him, socially necessary labour, i.e. human
labour and ‘dead’ labour (raw materials and machinery) used during the production process, provides
a common basis to assess the value of different commodities. Marx conceptualized this
quantitative aspect of commodities as the exchange-value.
Moreover, in capitalism the labour process is subjected to competition that implies that there is
pressure to reduce the time during which commodities are produced and how long it takes to realize
the surplus-value that commodities embody (see Jessop, 2007: 118). In capitalism, the accumulation
of capital and gaining profit becomes a purpose in itself. Hence, commodities’
‘market-mediated monetary value for the seller’ gains more importance in relation to commodities’
use-value than their ‘material and/or symbolic usefulness to the purchaser’ (Jessop, 2007: 126). In
a capitalist market economy only those commodities are produced for markets
that have exchange-value. For the purposes of this paper, exchange-value is
equated with commodities’ monetary value in markets.
Reflecting this, Lyotard (1984: 4) wrote that ‘knowledge is and will be produced in order to be
sold, and it is and will be consumed in order to be valorized in a new production: in both cases, the
goal is exchange’. Continuing from this, Lankshear et al. (2000: 22) have noted that knowledge
‘“ceases to become an end in itself”; it loses its use value and becomes, to all intents and purposes,
an exchange value alone’. Moreover, ‘knowledge is exteriorized with respect to the knower, and
the status of the learner and the teacher is transformed into a commodity relationship of “supplier”
and “user”’ (Lankshear et al., 2000: 22). Through the commodification process knowledge is transformed
into such (desired) objects which ‘can be captured through a monetary exchange relation’
(Deflem, 2003: 71).
However, it is contingent on whether an object such as knowledge becomes a capitalist commodity
or not. In Marxian terms, an object, such as knowledge, becomes a commodity only under
certain social relations, i.e. what counts as a commodity is socially determined. Furthermore, commodification
is in itself a complex process. For instance, Castree (2003: 279–83) has argued that
the capitalist commodification process consists of the following elements: privatization (exclusive
right to control an object), alienability (an object can be detached from its seller), individuation
(separating an object from its context via legal/material boundaries), abstraction (assimilation of a
specificity of an object to a broader type), valuation (monetization), and displacement (concealing
involved social relations). All in all, ‘capitalist commodification is a complex, polymorphous process
that is promiscuous in space and time’ (Castree, 2003: 283) and capitalist commodity, in turn,
is a complex ‘sociotechnical achievement’ (Castree, 2003: 280).
Complex Commodity Status of Knowledge
In Marxian tradition it has been argued that there are things that are use-values without having
value. These include, for instance, air and virgin soil, i.e. the natural environment (Marx, 1906
[1867]: 47) because they are not produced by people. In this sense knowledge is a different kind of
‘thing’: it has always been produced by people. Despite this difference, there are also some similarities
between land and knowledge as possible objects of commodification. By concentrating on
these similarities we can start to recognize multiple meanings, and difficulties, of the expression
‘knowledge as commodity’.
Karl Polanyi (1944: 71–3) argued that land, labour and money are fictitious commodities, i.e.
originally they are not produced for a market exchange. For instance, land was seen by him as ‘only
another name for nature, which is not produced by man’ (Polanyi, 1944: 72). According to Jessop
(2007: 118), ‘in contrast to a capitalist commodity, a fictitious commodity is not created in a profitoriented
labour process subject to the competitive pressures of market forces to rationalize its
production and reduce the turnover time of invested capital’. For instance, labour is not produced
in order to make profit after it has been sold to markets. In other words, people do not raise their
children in order to sell them to labour markets at some point in time. However, in establishing and
expanding the scope of the market economy during the 19th century, various actors described land,
labour and money as real commodities that require their own actual markets. It was this actively
developed and promoted ‘commodity fiction’ and the successful translation of it into policies that
enhanced the development of markets where land, labour and money would be bought and sold
like other commodities (Polanyi, 1944).
This is a highly important point and deserves a lengthy quotation from Polanyi. In the market
economy:
… every element of industry is regarded as having been produced for sale, as then and then only will it be
subject to the supply-and-demand mechanism interacting with price. In practice this means that there must
be markets for every element of industry … The crucial point is this: labor, land, and money are essential
elements of industry; they also must be organized in markets; in fact, these markets form an absolutely
vital part of the economic system. But labor, land, and money are obviously not commodities; the postulate
that anything that is bought and sold must have been produced for sale is emphatically untrue in regard to
them. In other words, according to the empirical definition of a commodity they are not commodities …
None of them is produced for sale. The commodity description of labor, land, and money is entirely
fictitious. Nevertheless, it is with the help of this fiction that the actual markets for labor, land, and money
are organized; they are being actually bought and sold on the market; their demand and supply are real
magnitudes; and any measures or policies that would inhibit the formation of such markets would ipso
facto endanger the self-regulation of the system. The commodity fiction, therefore, supplies a vital
organizing principle in regard to the whole of society affecting almost all its institutions in the most varied
way, namely, the principle according to which no arrangement or behavior should be allowed to exist that
might prevent the actual functioning of the market mechanism on the lines of the commodity fiction.
(Polanyi, 1944: 72)
Thus, for Polanyi, the translation of land, labour, and money into commodities to be exchanged in
markets signified the birth of such social forms in which markets have become the key institution
for the exchange of goods through the commodity of commodities, that is, money.
At least some of this also applies to knowledge: it has not been produced originally for market
exchange. Historically the production of knowledge has not taken place in the market, but rather in
guilds, universities, religious bodies and state institutions. Moreover, the production of knowledge
was rewarded, for instance, ‘through patronage, prestige, prizes, or income tied to rank or status
rather than to economic performance’ (Jessop, 2007: 121). In the framework of Polanyi’s empirical
definition of commodities, knowledge should also be seen as a fictitious commodity that might,
however, become treated as a real commodity in the context of some specific social relations and
belief systems. For example, in Medieval Europe knowledge was often interpreted as a gift from
God, and for this reason ideas were seen as inappropriate objects of property (e.g. Hesse, 2002).
This changed through the rise of capitalism and possessive individualism. These material and cultural
changes have been traced back to late 15th-century Italy where we can also find the first signs
of such patent systems that resemble modern patent systems in some meaningful way (see May and
Sell, 2006: 57–65, 82–7). Patents and other forms of intellectual property rights are in turn key
legal devices in the commodification of knowledge.
But when there is some commodity, there is also some kind of price. What is the commodity
price of knowledge? We can start to answer this question by taking a look at how Polanyi treated
land, labour and money in this respect. First, when land is bought and sold on markets, its price is
rent: ‘… rent is the price for the use of land and forms the income of those who supply it’ (Polanyi,
1944: 69). Second, ‘interest is the price for the use of money and forms the income of those who
are in the position to provide it’ (Polanyi, 1944: 69). Third, ‘wages are the price for the use of
labor power, and form the income of those who sell it’ (Polanyi, 1944: 69). In the case of knowledge,
it is, for instance, royalties that can be defined as the market price for the right to use patented
propositional knowledge. For example, universities are able to sell, that is license, their
patents to corporations and so have established external revenue sources in the form of royalty
payments.
But this does not mean that it would make sense to define knowledge as simply a commodity.
Given that there are different forms of knowledge (propositional and tacit knowledge), it makes sense
to expect that knowledge might also have different commodity forms in contemporary knowledge 
economies and, more specifically, in higher education. This intuitively feasible supposition is supported
by the insight that the capitalist market economy involves ‘impurities’ (Hodgson, 1988) in
a sense that all production is not aimed at markets and thus some objects are also produced for
non-market or quasi-market exchange. It has been argued in line with this that in capitalist economies
knowledge can circulate via reciprocal gift-giving while it is also allocated through profitoriented
markets (see Jessop, 2007: 116–22). These modes of circulation can, and often do, coexist.
It might also be the case that fluent allocation of knowledge through markets actually requires that
there also exist other modes of circulation, e.g. reciprocal gift-giving, since the latter tends to create
interpersonal trust. Trust, in turn, is seen in sociology as a non-economic basis of successful economic
activities.
More specifically, and on the basis of Marx and Polanyi, Jessop (2007: 122–5) has argued that
knowledge has a complex economic status in knowledge economies. By this he means that knowledge
can circulate in various ways within and between social systems. First, knowledge can circulate
as an intellectual commons. In this case knowledge is equivalent to a non-commodity especially
if it is produced and distributed through non-market mechanisms (e.g. patronage). Second, knowledge
can become a fictitious commodity when it ‘is enclosed through non-market mechanisms and
circulates as private property within the market’. Third, knowledge becomes a quasi-commodity
when knowledge production (intellectual labour) is formally subsumed under capitalist control and
competition. Fourth, knowledge becomes a real capitalist commodity when the real subsumption
of intellectual labour takes place, i.e. when knowledge is subsumed under capitalist labour processes.
Fifth, knowledge may also become a basis of ‘fictitious capital’ or a form of ‘fictive capital’.
This will be the case when revenue streams to knowledge producers (e.g. universities) are
guaranteed by intellectual property rights.
Jessop’s categorization is certainly a more elaborated way to approach our topic than just to say
that ‘if the production of knowledge has become a business, then knowledge itself has to some
extent become a commodity’ (Hall, 1979: 394). However, in certain respects Jessop’s categorization
is too broad for the purposes of this paper. Instead of concentrating on knowledge as commodity
per se, certain categories refer more directly to the conditions of knowledge work. For this
reason I do not base the forthcoming discussion systematically on it. For example, I do not discuss
whether and in what sense it might be plausible to argue that the production of knowledge is subsumed
under capitalist control and competition in higher education institutions. Instead, I approach
the knowledge–commodity relation from the perspective of the universities’ key functions.
However, before I move on I want to briefly address the relation between commodification of
knowledge and increased control of academic labour. Recently it has been stated that ‘personal and
technological forms of surveillance in the production process are necessary elements of the capitalist
economy’ (Fuchs, 2012: 14). In this respect it can be suggested that the commodification of
knowledge is one process that has contributed to the increased surveillance of academic labour since
this process is supposed to enhance corporations’ accumulation of capital in knowledge capitalism.
Thus, academic capitalism (e.g. commodification of knowledge, and related integration between
universities and market actors) ‘requires the direct and ideological control of employee behavior’
(Fuchs, 2012: 14) within higher education institutions, and in this way academic labour is becoming
subjected to ‘the instrumental and competitive logic of accumulation’ (Fuchs, 2012: 15).
Knowledge as Commodity in Higher Education
Commodification, or the commercialization of academic knowledge, and more broadly the marketization
of higher education has been an extensively studied topic at least since the mid-1990s 
(e.g. Baldini et al., 2006; Clark, 1998; Etzkovitz and Leydesdorff, 1998; Gibbons et al., 1994;
Goldfarb and Henrekson, 2003; Leisyte and Horta, 2011; Mirowski, 2011; Mirowski and Sent,
2002; Naidoo, 2003; Radder, 2010a; Sappey, 2005; Shumar, 2008; Slaughter and Leslie, 1997;
Slaughter and Rhoades, 2004).
We can start by noting that while academics do not usually sell such packaged commodities as
journal articles, books, or book chapters in markets for money, they can sell some other kinds of
packaged knowledge commodities such as consultation services, workshops or lectures in (quasi)
markets. Moreover, they may patent (depending on legislative conditions) their research results,
license them to some market actor, or establish start-up companies on the basis of those patents. In
other words, academics are able to commodify propositional knowledge in various ways. Especially
when they are patent-owners or have established start-up firms, they act like state-subsidized entrepreneurs
and this controversial status is one reason why academic entrepreneurs may want to
increase the financial and administrative autonomy of their universities, but do not necessarily
support the privatization of their university (Slaughter and Rhoades, 2004). In other words, they
want to retain their status as ‘academics who act as capitalists from within the public sector’
(Slaughter and Leslie, 2001: 154).
Articles, chapters, reports and books are, for researchers, pseudo-commodities (Shaw, 1975)
since the price of these products of the knowledge industry is usually not as important as the
publication in itself.5 Indeed, it is uncommon to receive direct payments for published journal
articles. In the case of patenting or establishing a start-up, the situation is different: the act of
patenting and establishing a start-up firm is not as important as the revenue these acts might
bring to individual researchers and higher education institutions. In these latter cases it can
be argued that products of the knowledge industry are something more than merely
pseudo-commodities.
These points imply that universities have various functions such as research, teaching and public
service, or outreach. One important parallel between these three missions is that each of them
involves gathering and sharing knowledge. Research is primarily about collecting data, conducting
research and sharing research results with the research community through articles, chapters, books
and conference presentations. Teaching, in turn, is primarily about disseminating analyzed knowledge
to students through lectures and seminars. Public service refers primarily to collecting and
analyzing knowledge in such a manner that it can be shared with some specific ‘client group’ outside
academia (Sauser et al., 1994: 4). Sometimes there might be overlaps between these categories
(e.g. in the case of technology transfer).
Now each of these functions may or may not also involve, depending for instance on the type
and goals of higher education institution, national/international legislation and characteristics of
respective national higher education system, such activities that are used to generate external revenue
through selling knowledge in various forms.6 The point is (again) that dissemination of
knowledge can be based on different ways of circulating knowledge (e.g. gift and market exchange),
and these may coexist within same organization. This is one reason why universities are internally
complex organizations with contradictory aims, visions and strategies.
More broadly, the commodification of knowledge in the field of higher education is one example
of the broader ‘second enclosure movement’ (Boyle, 2003). The first enclosure movement
started in England in the 15th century and it refers especially to the process of fencing off common
land and turning it into private property by different means and varieties of state involvement
(Boyle, 2003: 33–4). In the second enclosure movement, knowledge (instead of land) is treated as
a private good and subjected to commodification. Reflecting on this, Radder (2010b: 4) has
pointed out that commodification of academic research can be seen as part of ‘the economization, 
or economic instrumentalization, of human activities and institutions, or even entire social subsystems’
(Radder, 2010b: 4). In this sense ‘academic commodification means that all kinds of scientific
activities and their results are predominantly interpreted and assessed (dominantly) on the
basis of economic criteria’ (Radder, 2010b: 4).
Given that universities have different key functions it makes sense to think that in the context of
higher education, there are at least two modes of the commodification of knowledge. First, the
commodification of knowledge refers to ‘commodification of academic research’ (Radder, 2010b:
4). This category in turn refers to ‘commercialization, that is, the pursuit of profit by academic
institutions through selling expertise of their researchers and the results of their inquiries’ (Radder,
2010b: 4). Second, commodification of higher education refers to commodified educational products
as delivered by higher education institutions. Commodification of educational products
implies that students are increasingly seen as customers whose ‘needs and wants … [are placed] at
the centre of organisational focus and strategy’ (Sappey, 2005: 496).
These modes of the commodification of knowledge in the field of higher education are not only
examples of the second enclosure movement, but also, in a broader sense, of ‘intensive enlargement’
of capitalism (Robinson, 2004: 7), i.e. deepening the commodification of social relations. Or,
to put it another way, through commodification of knowledge, money7 also enters into those social
interactions and relations (e.g. Simmel, 2004 [1907]) that were previously regulated by other
means, or at least commodification of knowledge implies that the role of money in knowledge
production acquires new dimensions.
Given the technological advancements since the 1970s, distribution of knowledge via global
communication networks has become easier, which has in turn increased the opportunities to commodify
educational products, for instance in the form of distance learning. In other words, technological
development has increased the possibilities to develop activities through which higher
education services can be sold in the global marketplace. Commodification of educational products
can also be aimed to attract transnationally mobile students to respective universities and nationstates.
This implies that those social processes that constitute commodification of educational
products and academic research do not necessarily take place within nation-state boundaries, but
transnationally. Furthermore, commodification of educational products and research has been promoted
both in academia and policy circles through various hegemonic discourses and narratives
such as the ‘knowledge-based economy’ (e.g. Kenway et al., 2006).
Also, and reflecting Polanyi’s discussion on fictitious commodities, it has been argued that:
Most educational offerings, although divided into units of credit and exchanged for tuition, are fictitious
commodities in that they are not created by the educator strictly with this purpose [to produce them for
market exchange] in mind. Here we will be using the term commodity, not in this fictitious, more expansive,
sense but rather in its classical, restricted sense, to mean something expressly created for market exchange.
The commodification of higher education, then, refers to the deliberate transformation of the educational
process into commodity form, for the purpose of commercial transaction. (Noble, 2002)
Finally, outreach or public service also refers to such activities and processes as continuing education
programs, extension services, technical assistance, organized consultation efforts and so forth
(e.g. Sauser et al., 1994: 3, 7) through which knowledge can be commodified. For example, if the
content of outreach activity (such as workshops) is ‘hot’, or ‘sexy’, the speaker considered ‘high
profile’ and people have some immediate need for knowledge, outreach organizations are able
(other things being equal) to put an expensive price tag on the right to attend the service in question
(Emil, 1995).
Refusal of the Arguments Against the Idea of Knowledge as
Commodity
At this point some may argue that previous discussion provides too simplified an account of the
knowledge–commodity relation. I agree with this since knowledge is a very peculiar sort of commodity
(see e.g. Stehr, 1994). For this reason, we need to take into consideration some of those
arguments according to which knowledge cannot be treated as a commodity. Next I critically discuss
some of these arguments in order to show that they are not watertight, for which reason the
key question is not whether knowledge can be commodified, but whether it should be commodified
as for instance John O’Neill (1998) has pointed out. This is a very important and complex normative
question and, unfortunately, impossible to tackle within the limits of this paper.
First, it has been claimed that there is certain initial difficulty involved in thinking of knowledge
as a commodity because ‘one cannot know its [use] value until one has access to it’ (O’Neill, 1998:
149). For this reason there is a paradox in determining the price for knowledge. As Arrow (1971)
has pointed out, one (i.e. a buyer) cannot know the value of knowledge before one has access to it,
but at that point (after having the access to it) one would have acquired it without cost. Hence, there
would be no reason to pay for knowledge.
Indeed, when comparing to, for example, buying a car, the situation seems to be clearly different.
One has access to a car in any meaningful sense only after one has bought it (i.e. when one is
the owner of a car), but this does not seem to be the case with knowledge. If the content of knowledge
is revealed to you or you have acquired it otherwise, you already have access to it even if you
would not have paid for it. And once you know the content of knowledge (e.g. content of the lecture),
there is no necessary reason to buy it: you are already in a position where you can enjoy the
benefits of it. In contrast, you are able to enjoy the benefits (and perhaps also some disadvantages)
of the car only when there has been a transfer of property rights.
However, it can be argued that it is not necessary to know the content of knowledge in order to
be able to assess its value since it can be ‘measured in terms of behavioral capacities’ (O’Neill,
1998: 149). To know the content of knowledge is a different issue from knowing what an individual,
i.e. buyer, would be able to do with this knowledge. The latter can be communicated to a
potential buyer without revealing the content of knowledge. For example, if I am interested in
some particular course (e.g. Medieval Arabic Philosophy and how it influenced European
Philosophy) that is not offered free-of-charge, I do not have to know every detail of the course’s
content before I am able to make an informed decision regarding whether it makes sense to pay for
it. It might be enough if I have been told (by a reliable source) that this course would increase my
chances in the labour market or that I would be better prepared to complete, for instance, my master’s
thesis. And for this reason I would have an incentive to pay for it.
Second, some might also point out that it is not possible to commodify knowledge and information
because they cannot be alienated (O’Neill, 1998: 149–50). This claim is based on the
idea that one cannot sell knowledge in a same sense as one can sell, for instance, a car because
after the transaction, ‘the seller retains the capacity to use and benefit from’ (O’Neill, 1998:
150) the knowledge; i.e. I, as a seller, can still use it. This is not the case with a car: when I have
sold my car to another person, I have lost my capacity to use and benefit from it. However, this
kind of argument is based on a mistaken view of property. Property is not a thing but rather a
set of rights, a social institution. Moreover, during the modern era it does not make much
sense to speak of property as a social institution without also referring to the legislative
authority of nation states. In a modern sense, there is no property without nation-states (e.g.
May and Sell, 2006).
Hence, alienation of property is not the same thing as the alienation of an object as such. The
former refers, rather, to the alienation of property rights and the capacities to use an object. Of
course, it is not possible to literally transfer knowledge during the exchange process, but it is possible
to transfer property rights regarding knowledge, i.e. intellectual property rights that regulate
who can use and benefit from knowledge. After I have sold my rights to use some piece of codified
knowledge I still ‘have’ that knowledge (unless I have forgotten it) but I cannot legally use and
benefit from it. For this reason it is reasonable to argue that knowledge can be alienated in terms of
property rights.
Third, there is still at least one more possible, and related, objection against the idea of knowledge
as a commodity that we have to deal with. Many have claimed that instead of being an object
for exchange on markets, knowledge is an example of a (global) public good that is (a) nonrivalrous,
and (b) non-excludable (see e.g. David and Foray, 2002: 19; O’Neill, 1998: 150). Marx
(1906 [1867]) paid attention to the public good nature of scientific knowledge when he stated that
once, for instance, the law of the magnetization of iron is discovered its use doesn’t cost a penny.
Non-rivalrous of knowledge refers to the idea that the consumption of the knowledge by some
person or persons does not decrease the possibility of others consuming it. For instance, when I use
the theory of academic capitalism in my research it does not decrease, other things being equal, the
possibility for others to use same theory in their research. Contrary to this, when I use some particular
computer in writing an article manuscript, others’ possibility to use the same computer has
decreased.
Non-excludability, in turn, refers to the idea that other individuals cannot be excluded from the
benefit of using the knowledge, or some other public good (e.g. [clean] air). Hence, the market
would be an inadequate institutional framework for public goods such as knowledge since everyone
‘has a reason to be a free-rider, to benefit from the consumption of the good without contributing
towards its costs’ (O’Neill, 1998: 150).
However, it has been argued that while codified knowledge approximates to the status of a public
good, tacit knowledge, such as ‘expertise’, is a different matter since it is not accessible to all
who would like to have it. Hence, in this view, tacit knowledge seems to be more open to the
exchange process in the market, for instance, in the form of consultancy science aimed at both
private and governmental actors. Despite this, and as O’Neill (1998: 150) has convincingly argued,
it is not self evident that codified knowledge is beyond commodification or that it is a universal
public good. The point here is that scientific, codified knowledge is accessible only to those persons
who have the required skills and competencies to understand it. Otherwise, some scientific
result or theory (e.g. game theory) would not be much more than a mere illegible scrawl on paper.
For this reason it would be an overstatement to say that scientific knowledge can be possessed and
used by everyone. In this sense, scientific knowledge should, perhaps, be seen as contextual, rather
than a universal, public good. Everyone can enjoy the benefits of street lights, but everyone does
not have in the same sense the capability (e.g. because s/he has not been able to pay tuition fees) to
do research based on, for instance, statistical or discourse analysis. In other words, cognitive skills
are scarce, their acquisition takes time and they cannot be transmitted as effortlessly as, for instance,
information in the form of datasets (e.g. Stehr, 1994).
The claim that knowledge is a non-excludable public good can also be challenged by referring
to intellectual property rights (IPRs) that give agents a possibility to control the use of knowledge.
Hence, for instance, patents and copyrights are powerful institutional tools to commodify knowledge
because they define rights and obligations of various parties and, therefore, what people can,
and cannot, do with the knowledge. For example, patents are like invisible fences that provide
exclusive rights to knowledge holders and put knowledge into private domains, i.e. make it a 
non-public good, and in this way are key elements of the second enclosure movement. Due to this,
IPRs are often able to prevent ‘collective knowledge enhancement … [because] what is being
passed around cannot be enriched, commented upon, and recombined by others’, i.e. IPRs generate
‘waste’ (David and Foray, 2002: 19).
IPRs do not merely make it possible to commodify knowledge and block access to various consumer
goods such as poems and life-saving drugs; they have also made it conceivable to think,
write and speak of knowledge as a commodity. Here, one can find the broader and more fundamental
importance of IPRs: unless it is conceivable to think, write and speak of knowledge as a commodity
in the first place, it would be hard to imagine and develop such institutional arrangements
that would contribute to the commodification of knowledge. In other words, the commodification
of knowledge has also required its own ‘commodity fiction’, i.e. there has been a need to produce
and promote actively the idea that knowledge is a scarce resource because knowledge, indeed, is a
peculiar sort of good (see also Stehr, 1994: 109–11). For this reason, Simmel (2004 [1907]: 442)
seemed to think that knowledge, and specifically academic knowledge, would be most resistant
towards commodification: ‘It has been rightly suggested that theoretical notions… are like a torch
whose light does not become dimmer by igniting innumerable others from it. Inasmuch as their
potential boundless dissemination has no influence whatsoever upon their importance, they elude
private ownership more than any other contents of life.’
But as the decades, especially since the 1980s, have shown, deepening commodification of
social relations (i.e. the intensive enlargement of capitalism) has become more and more apparent
in the field of knowledge production including higher education. But, as Slaughter and Rhoades
(2004) have pointed out, academics and universities cannot be reduced to a position of passive
by-standers, or powerless victims of external social forces. Quite the contrary, they have actively
contributed to this intensive enlargement of capitalism or second enclosure movement by developing
and participating together with state and economic actors in such market and market-like
activities that have made possible the commodification of academic research and education.
An Illustrative Example: The Tuli Program
Lastly, I provide a short example from Finland of how the commodification of knowledge within
higher education has been promoted by governmental actors. This example focuses only on the
commodification of academic research. Finland is known for its free-of-charge higher education,
but as it has recently been argued (Kauppinen and Kaidesoja, forthcoming), the Finnish higher
education system has also taken significant steps, or perhaps great leaps, towards academic capitalism
at least since the 1990s. One example of this is the so-called Tuli Program. ‘Tuli’ is the Finnish
word for ‘fire’. In this context it comes from words ‘tutkimuksesta liiketoimintaa’ which can be
translated as ‘transformation of research into business’, or ‘business from research’. This program
was initially launched in 1993 (Kuusisto et al., 2004) and its current phase (2008) runs until 2012.
The program is funded mainly (60%) by Tekes (the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology
and Innovation) and Tekes in turn is funded by the Ministry of Employment and Economy. The rest
of the funding comes from the Universities which are funded mainly by the Ministry of Education
and Culture (Hytönen and Tolvanen, 2011).
Tuli’s aim is to help ‘researchers and research communities to evaluate the commercial potential
of research-based inventions or ideas and aids in the process of their commercialization’ (Tuli,
2012a). Moreover, ‘Tuli aims to give birth to new research-based business with the aid of license
agreements, know-how transfers and new companies. In other words, Tuli aims to commercialize
research results in Finnish universities and research institutes’ (Tuli, 2012a).
This program is based on cooperation with the technology transfer offices (or R&D and innovation
services, as they are often called in Finland) of 14 Finnish universities, 21 polytechnics and
five research institutes (Tuli, 2012a). Some of the universities have organized, for instance, ‘commercialization
clinics’ for their researchers in order to facilitate their efforts in bringing their
research-based ideas to markets.
Researchers are invited to bring their ideas and inventions to commercialization experts for
research, i.e. ‘to the able hands of Tuli’ (Tuli, 2012a): ‘We will evaluate your idea’s potential,
open the right doors for you, provide you with the relevant professional contacts and offer
funding up to 55 000 euros – with no risk involved. Tuli helps you in the process of commercializing
your research results. You won’t need any funding of your own. Spark your idea
into life and let Tuli help you in realizing new possibilities!’ (Tuli, 2012b, emphasis in
original).
In 2008, a total of 693 projects received funding from the Tuli Program. Twenty-six projects
were commercialized through technology transfer and these projects brought a total income of
€920,000. This amount is 34% of all the incomes reported for licensing and technology sales of
Finnish universities in the same year (Tuli, 2012c). Between 2008 and 2012, Tekes funded the Tuli
Program with €12m.
Thus, in this program, academic, research-based ‘ideas’ are seen as lifeless objects, but the
program is there to help researchers ‘spark’ those lifeless objects into ‘life’ through commercializing
them and, ultimately, by bringing them to markets as commodities (in the form of goods or
services). In this way the commodification of academic research is defined as a more crucial
process, or practice, than academic research that is seen more like an initial step towards market
exchange.
This is rather problematic from the point of view of the internal goods of science (e.g.
free circulation of knowledge) since the program is (naturally) based on ‘professional
secrecy’ and ‘non-disclosure agreements’: ‘Note: all Tuli-related operations and communication
are strictly confidential. Every person involved in handling any project-related material
is bound to professional secrecy or bound by a separate Tuli-related non-disclosure
agreement’ (Tuli, 2012d).
This case illustrates how governmental actors actively participate in the commodification of
knowledge by making substantial economic investments. The main reason for this is that they see
the commodification of knowledge as one precondition of a successful national innovation system
which, in turn, is supposed to contribute to economic growth, new jobs and, more broadly, a successful
Finnish knowledge-based economy. At the same it demonstrates how academic knowledge
is valued on the basis of its commercial potentiality. In other words, the Tuli example reflects
Radder’s argument about how economic criteria start to (partially) dominate academic knowledge
production when it is subjected to the process of commodification.
In more abstract terms, the Tuli Program case illustrates how academic capitalism, i.e. blurring
of boundaries between universities, state, and markets, operates in the Finnish context. Moreover,
the Tuli Program illustrates how the Finnish higher education system is adopting an academic
capitalist knowledge regime in which knowledge is treated as a private good rather than a public
good (e.g. Slaughter and Rhoades, 2004). However, an academic capitalist knowledge regime and
a public good knowledge regime coexist (i.e. they should be seen as models representing different
poles of the private–public continuum), and it is a fundamentally empirical question as to what
extent knowledge circulates as a private or public good within academia, and between academia
and the broader social world, or how these aspects (private and public good) are interwoven in
any particular case.

Conclusion
I hope this paper has contributed generally to higher education studies and other social scientifically
oriented studies on the knowledge economy, and specifically to the conceptual basis of discussions
on (transnational) academic capitalism since one key implication of this paper is that the
term ‘academic capitalism’ is justifiable at least in a sense that knowledge can be (other things
being equal) produced and sold to increase the economic capital of universities. And this economic
capital can then be invested in other activities and processes that are aimed to bring further external
revenues to the university.
Thus, if we accept that commodity form is a crucial aspect of capitalistic market economies,
then the demonstration that knowledge can be, and is, treated as commodity within the field of
higher education gives us reason to suppose that ‘academic capitalism’ is not merely a metaphor.
Another related question is whether the term ‘academic capitalism’ is justified also in a sense that
the production of knowledge in universities, or industry–university collaborations shares characteristics
of the capitalist mode of production. This is an issue which requires further attention in
academic capitalism studies.
However, in making claims such as ‘knowledge has become commodity’ or ‘higher education has
been commodified’ one has to be careful, because the commodity status of knowledge is a manysided
question. For instance, marketing and selling higher education products to transnationally
mobile students is a different kind of process than selling research results through patents to some
(transnational) corporation. While the former is aimed at multiple consumers, the aim of the latter
is rather to generate external revenue by licensing the product to some particular corporation.
Moreover, even if we are able to argue plausibly that knowledge has become a commodity, it
does not necessarily mean that it has become a capitalist commodity. The expression ‘knowledge as
commodity’ can mean several things and they cannot be assimilated to some overarching conception.
This topic clearly needs further research on both theoretical and empirical levels. Overall, we
need to be careful in our conceptualizations. In the field of higher education the economic status of
knowledge cannot be dealt with through the simplistic dichotomy of public good vs. private good.
Finally, in this article I have attempted to articulate how contemporary university transformations
and increasingly blurred boundaries between universities, states and markets can be seen as
an example of the second enclosure movement. This movement manifests itself in the form of
commodification of knowledge and this process poses a threat to any ‘knowledge community’
(David and Foray, 2002: 14–16) that is based on such rules as reciprocity and the free flow of
knowledge. In this respect, the key implication is that higher education, and more broadly knowledge
production, has become an increasingly important research topic for any social science that
aims to increase our critical understanding of contemporary social transformations, and the continuing
capability of capitalism to renew and expand its boundaries despite (or perhaps because) of
its simultaneous crises. In this respect the main suggestion of this paper is that there is a need to
update theories of global capitalism (see Sklair, 2002; Robinson, 2004) since they have failed to
pay sufficient attention to one of the key processes that create tensions within contemporary capitalism,
i.e. commodification of knowledge (Kauppinen, 2012, forthcoming).

Notes
1. For a critical account of the concept of ‘knowledge-based economy’ and whether it provides an adequate
description of current economic realities, see Jessop (2008).
2. The process of commodification in itself has been approached from both non-Marxist and Marxist point
of views (e.g. Castree, 2003: 274).
3. Scientific knowledge is taught to include various specific characteristics: it is systematic, and it is collected,
analyzed and synthesized through scientific methods, and the aim of science is often to produce
generalizable knowledge. Furthermore, scientific knowledge can refer to the results of basic research and
applied science.
4. However, since the question of how the relation between explicit and implicit knowledge should be understood
is not the key question in this paper, I will not engage in a more detailed discussion on this topic.
Suffice to say that I am sympathetic to Hildreth and Kimble’s basic idea that all knowledge involves in
varying degrees both soft and hard elements given the necessarily social nature of all knowledge.
5. Of course, the act of publication increases a researcher’s academic capital which can be translated into
other forms of capital such as money capital through promotion, increased salary, and so forth.
6. I do recognize that commodification of knowledge in the context of higher education has required legislative
changes, but there is no room here to discuss them in any systematic sense. However, one example is
the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) trade liberalization agreement, the General Agreement on Trade in
Services (GATS) that repositioned higher education as an attractive service industry and global export that
can be sold in the global marketplace (e.g. Naidoo, 2003; Robertson et al., 2002).
7. Money and knowledge share one common feature that other commodities do not seem to have. Both
money and knowledge can be made, or kept secret. Simmel (2004 [1907]: 388) writes, ‘compared with all
other goods, money can be made invisible and non-existent to others and thus has affinities with intellectual
possessions. Just as the private and, as it were, solipsistic character of mental possessions both begins
and ends with keeping silent, so the private individualistic nature of money finds its complete expression
in the possibility of keeping it secret.’
